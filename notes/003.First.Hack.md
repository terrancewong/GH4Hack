Manipulate Camera Info.

**WARNING**

**The following operation has unknown potential risk of disabling (bricking) your camera. Proceed with caution and au your own risk. I am NOT responsible for any consequences.**

## Exp 1

edit `GH4U.TXT` with any text editor, at line 248

```
H0f0 xxxl,xxxh,yyyl,yyyh,zzzl,zzzh,wwwl,wwwh,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,
```

- `xxxh,xxxl` is Power Counter, uint32 (by guess).
 indicates Number of Power On, which means, if you reset it to 0, after power on, it will change to 1.
- `yyyh,yyyl` is Shutter Counter uint32 (by guess, very likely)
- `zzzh,zzzl` should be Flash Counter, uint32

example
```
H0f0 0064,0000,0080,0000,0020,0000,0008,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000,
