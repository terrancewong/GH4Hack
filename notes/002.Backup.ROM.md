### 2.1 `GH4F.TXT`

`GH4F.TXT` is hex dump of 48KiB (49152 bytes, 0x6000) data. Hex data grouping by 2 octets (16bits)

Contains at least
1. Serial number? of MainPCB?
2. Another serial number, of Body?
3. Yet another serial number
4. Sensor (bad pixel / calibration) data?, addr 0x0800 to 0x0fff?, {uint16 x, uint16 y}, but max corodinnate is larger than 4816x3427, might have some offset
5. Mount calibratiion data?

### 2.2 GH4U.TXT

`GH4U.TXT` is hex dump of 18KiB (18432 bytes, 0x2400) data. Hex data grouping by 2 octets (16bits). This name seems indicate **User data**

Contains at least
1. Power cycles: uint32, addr 0x1e00 (byte) or 0x0f00 (word)
2. Shutter counter: uint32, addr 0x1e04 (byte)
3. Flash fire counter? : uint32, addr 0x1e08 (byte)
4. some counter? : uint32, addr 0x1e0c (byte)
5. unknown repeated pattern: 0x4000 .. 0x41bf
6. Some `aPan` headers?
